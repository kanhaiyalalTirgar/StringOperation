Character Frequency Analyzer

A C# console application that analyzes an input string to find and display the most frequently occurring character (case-insensitive) along with its count. Special handling is included for space characters.


## Key Features

 - Takes user input and converts it to lowercase for case-insensitive analysis
 - Identifies the character with the highest frequency
 - Special output formatting for space characters
 - Efficient character counting by removing processed characters from the string

## Code Structure

- Single-file solution (Program.cs)
- Main method contains all logic (could be refactored into separate methods)
- Uses basic string manipulation and loops



## Usage Example

To deploy this project run

```bash
  Input the string : 
  Hello World
  Max Frequently character : l : 3
```
