Character Frequency Analyzer - GitHub Summary

Project Description:
A C# console application that analyzes an input string to find and display the most frequently occurring character (case-insensitive) along with its count. Special handling is included for space characters.

Key Features:
• Takes user input and converts to lowercase for case-insensitive analysis
• Identifies the character with the highest frequency
• Special output formatting for space characters
• Efficient character counting by removing processed characters

Code Structure:
• Program.cs - Single-file solution
• Main method contains all logic
• Uses basic string manipulation and loops

Potential Improvements:
[1] Refactoring: Extract counting logic into separate methods
[2] Edge Cases: Handle empty string input
[3] Enhancements: Option to show all character frequencies
[4] Case Sensitivity: Add option for case-sensitive analysis
[5] Performance: Optimize for very long strings

Usage Example:
Input the string: 
Hello World
Max Frequently character: l : 3

Suggested GitHub Files:
• Program.cs - Main code file
• README.md - With usage instructions
• .gitignore - For C# projects

This would make a good beginner/intermediate C# project to demonstrate string manipulation and basic algorithms.
